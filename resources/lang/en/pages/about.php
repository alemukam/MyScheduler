    'par1-1' => 'Team LatvijaFF is a football freestyle community which was established in Riga (Latvia) in 2015 by four local freestylers. The main goal of the community is to popularize the sport in Latvia by organizing various events, i.e. football freestyle meetings in Riga and other major cities and performances at different kinds of events. One of the biggest problems concerning football freestyle in Latvia is that the sport is not that popular as in other European countries and for quite a long time there have been no newcomers to the Latvian community. Therefore, the current short-term target is to establish the academy where everyone will have an opportunity to learn how to freestyle with a football.',
    'par1-2' => 'However, due to the worldwide football freestyle crisis in late summer 2017, the community has suffered a significant loss and was forced to leave the Football Freestyle Federation right after SuperBall 2017 which was held in Prague.',
    'par1-3' => 'The president and CEO of the community Andrey Nosik started looking for new opportunities for conducting business. Having had a strong programming background he decided that the community could offer IT solutions for all football freestylers around the globe. That is how the development department was established.',
    'head2' => 'Vision of Andrey Nosik',
    'par2-1' => 'Before the crisis in 2017 football freestyle communities had been growing quite fast and they had been making creating websites of the local communities using latest technologies because demand for modern-level functionality was quite high. And that is why they purchased professional services for specialized companies and it cost a lot.',
    'par2-2' => 'Now after the crisis, many communities cannot allow paying the maintenance fee for the created web pages and it is the problem I found. I think that freestyle must keep developing, communities must keep growing notwithstanding a potential lack of financial resources and the Internet is required in order to achieve it. Therefore, we have established our IT department of the LatvijaFF community where we help other football freestyle communities design and host web pages and hopefully more people will see them.',
